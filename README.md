## Styling react components

Covered a variety of methods for styling react components such as

- Using the styled-components npm package to handle styling on it's own component that inherits props, with the ability to dynamically change values using `${props => prop method name ? 'some-class' : 'some-other-class' }`
- Using `react-scripts` to import scoped css styles from a stylesheet and render them out by accessing the object and the classname required such as `className={styles.button}`
